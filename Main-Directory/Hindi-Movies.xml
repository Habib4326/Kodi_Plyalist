At the airport they are received by their tour-guide, Ranga, who appears to be somewhat disturbed upon hearing Googly’s name. An incomprehensible sadness betrays Ranga’s cool demeanor. Googly is awestruck by the beauty of sunset amidst the snow-capped mountains and is inspired to go hiking.  Shorya, though initially reluctant, finally yields. They set out on their trek and the appalling beauty of the mountains overwhelms them. In a moment of romantic fervour, Shorya slips and falls off the cliff and gets stuck on a crest at the edge of a steep fall. Hereafter, the movie follows Googly and Ranga on their individual rescue missions-- Googly’s to save Shorya and Ranga’s to find Googly. And amidst all this, flitting on and off the screen, is a ghastly figure in the cave whom Shorya dismisses as a figment of his own imagination</plot>
